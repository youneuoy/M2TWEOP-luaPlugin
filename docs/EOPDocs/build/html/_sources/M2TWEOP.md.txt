## What is M2TW Engine Overhaul Project?

M2TW Engine Overhaul Project is designed to expand the capabilities of the game *Medieval 2: Total War*.

The functionality of the program is divided into two parts

1. Making changes to the game code when starting MTW2 (changing various engine limits, finer tuning, etc.)
2. Manipulations with the game after its launch.



### Features

* Hugely expanded scripting system
* Transfer your battles from the campaign map to online. This allows you to play out Hotseat battles online and transfer the results back to the campaign map.
* Allows you to set your own limits for the number of religions, ancillaries, block resizing units
* Set the boundaries of the number of soldiers in units, the size of the battle map and the cost of siege equipment (rams, ladders, siege towers)
* Make any characters immortal and change the way their age is displayed on the screen
* Fixed crash when using berserkers in battle
* Added ability to write your own add-ons in C ++. The library exports many different functions.
* and many many more

## Project composition
* [M2TWEOP Library](https://github.com/youneuoy/M2TWEOP-library) - main project
* [M2TWEOP LUA plugin](https://github.com/youneuoy/M2TWEOP-luaPlugin) - a plugin that adds the ability to script in the lua language (from game logic to extending the interface), add new console to the game and much more.

### Compatibility

This program works with game versions 1.5 (disk version) and 1.52 (steam version).

### Usage

All program settings are set in the config files and scripts and are applied when the game starts. You can read more about this on the [forums](https://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?803575-Download-links-important-information-and-instructions-for-the-program-in-pictures).
All changes made work correctly in an ongoing campaign, nothing breaks during updates, itâ€™s enough just not to activate new features.

If you use an antivirus, add the program to the exceptions! There may be false positives.

## Build
M2TWEOP is developed in C++ and Assembly. You can get support for building/developing on the our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Epqjm8u2WK) server.

## Support the project

It would be nice if all interested people supported the project in an accessible way (for example, you can test various changes, participate in planning new game mechanics or discuss them, sponsor development with money, etc.).
* Come join the our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Epqjm8u2WK) server if you have questions or suggestions.

With the help of this program, it will probably be possible someday to give modders the opportunity to change the MTW2 gameplay beyond recognition.
