## How to Generate The Battle Setup

  1. Close the window that appears, **save the game** and click 'Play Battle'
  2. Wait for the battle to load
  3. Once we see this message, the battle setup has been generated.

  4. Exit the battle and navigate to 
  
         Medieval II Total War\mods\<YOUR_MOD_NAME>\eopBattles\lastBattle

  5. Here we will have a folder that matches the name that was displayed in the battle deployment screen. In our case, the folder is called 'summer_T0_milan' (It is summer, we are at Turn 0 and playing as 'Milan')
  *  Copy that folder and paste it into to 
  
         Medieval II Total War\mods\<YOUR_MOD_NAME>\data\world\maps\battle\custom

* Now we can host a Multiplayer Lobby/play a Historical Battle and use our generated battle as our 'Scenario'

**NOTE: If you will play this battle online, make sure all other players also follow this step. Send them the battle setup folder (e.g 'summer_T0_milan') and make sure they place it in the same place.**

  *  The battle is complete and the results of the battle have been generated and written to  
  
         Medieval II Total War\mods\<YOUR_MOD_NAME>\eopBattles\lastBattleResult\m2tweopBattleResults.json

## How to Transfer The Battle Results
Now that you have generated the battle setup, played the battle online or in a Historical Battle, we can transfer the results back to the campaign map.

1. Load your save game before the battle occured
2. In this example, Rohan was attacker and Rohan won the battle so we select the winner as 'Attacker'

4. Select 
  
        m2tweopBattleResults.json
5. Select 'Transfer results now'

**NOTE: BATTLE RESULTS DISPLAYED ON THIS SCREEN WILL NOT BE ACCURATE BUT RESULTS TRANSFERRED TO CAMPAIGN MAP WILL BE**

### FAQ
1. If the mod does not start, please double check your settings (like the config file) or come and chat in the [M2TWEOP discord](https://discord.gg/VSX4359jNW)
2. 'Versions are incomptaible' error when hosting a multiplayer game. Medieval 2 Online requries all players to have the EXACT same files and file structure when playing an online game. Please ensure your friend has the correct files and your versions match.
